   The deployment of commit
    <a href="{{ commit.reference | commit_url(repository=repository, scm=scm) }}">{{ commit.reference}}</a>
    was cancelled
</p>

<p>
    <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>
    In case the deployment was cancelled during infrastructure provisioning,
    there might be resources that haven't been fully provisioned, which means
    youâ€™ll need another deployment to make sure they're fully functional.

    If you notice any subsequent failures or anything unusual after you re-deploy,
